                    crops
                    are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
                    inherently
                    dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before
                    we
                    called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
